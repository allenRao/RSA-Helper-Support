# Let's Encrypt	

Use RSA asymmetric encryption algorithm to encrypt text, photos, videos, and files.
 All your rsa keys and data are encrypted & stored in your device and private iCloud.
 -----------------------------------------
You create your own RSA key pair in your device, then exchange public keys with friends.
Send encrypted messages and files on chat apps or emails, so that no third party can spy on your data.

----------------------------------------------------
The main features:
    * Message decryption: 
        Decrypt ciphertext with your own private key.

    * Message encryption: 
        Encrypt  message with your friend's public key.

    * File encryption:
        Use your friend's public key to encrypt files;
        ziprsa is the encrypted file extension.

    * File decryption:
        Use your own private key to decrypt the ziprsa files;

    * RSA Keys Management:
        Create your own RSA key pair, public key and private key;
        Store and manage your friendsâ€™ public keys;

    * iCloud Sync RSA Keys:  
                Sync RSA keys to your private iCloud.

    * Face ID to Access App.

    * Local LAN file transfer:
        File web server , upload, download within local LAN.

    * Message Encryption Extended Keyboard:
        encrypt the text in the input box, and send it.
        Use your own private key to decrypt the ciphertext in the pastboard.
        Send your own public key to your friends.

         * In-app purchase Pro version:  
                 encrypt larger files than 10 Mb.
                 Syc rsa keys to iCloud.
                 Face ID authentication.

-----------------------------------------------------
When to tell your family members the bank card password via text message, send it after encryption to prevent the password from being leaked.
When to send a private message to your girlfriend through WeChat, send it after encryption to ensure privacy and security.
When to send confidential files to colleagues through QQ, send them after encryption to prevent file leakage.

Assume that user A and user B plan to have encrypted communication through WeChat.
User A creates his own key pair locally, including public key a and private key a.
User B also creates his own key pair locally, including public key b and private key b.
Then A and B exchange public keys through WeChat, and save each other's public keys.
User A uses public key b to encrypt the message into ciphertext, and the ciphertext is sent to user B via WeChat.
User B decrypts the ciphertext with his own private key b.
User A and user B can also use the same method to encrypt files for transmission.

----------------------------------------------------
Privacy:
       We will never upload your rsa keys and data. All your data are encrypted and stored in your device and your private iCloud.
