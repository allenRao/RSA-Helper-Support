# Seal Mail	

Seal is an end-to-end encryption email client to prevent email service providers from scanning your messages.
Seal is dedicated to keep your email secure & private in LLM era.
Seal, end-to-end encryption email client makes it impossible for anyone to read your emails except the sender and recipient, like Outlook with encryption.
Emails are encypted on the client side using  the encryption keys that email accounts providers have no access to. This means the email service providers do not have the ability to spy your messages.
Leveraging Curve25519 public-key cryptography and AES from Apple's operating system, we guarantee encryption algorithms free from clandestine backdoors.
Generate your own key pairs containing private and public keys on your device. Share public keys with your contacts to encrypt emails, and use private keys to decrypt them.

With the Seal app, you can:
- Seamlessly integrate your email accounts using app passwords provided by your email service providers.
- Take control of your security by generating your own key pairs, comprising public and private keys.
- Safely send and receive encrypted emails and attachments via IMAP and SMTP protocols.

Embark on secure communication journeys like Alice and Bob with our email encryption app. 
Alice and Bob each generate their own key pairs, comprising public and private keys. Alice's keys are denoted as (A, a), while Bob's are (B, b).
With their keys securely stored locally, Alice and Bob exchange public keys via email and save them for future communication. 
Alice crafts her message, encrypting it with Bob's public key (B) to produce ciphertext. This encrypted message is then seamlessly sent to Bob.
Upon receipt, Bob employs his private key (b) to decrypt the ciphertext, revealing Alice's original message. 

Experience the privacy and security in your email conversations with our app.
